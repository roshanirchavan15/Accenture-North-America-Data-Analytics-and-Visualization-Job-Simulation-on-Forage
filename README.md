# Social Media Client Analysis - Accenture Simulation

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a Data Analyst simulation at Accenture. The goal was to advise a hypothetical social media client by uncovering content trends through data analysis to inform strategic decision-making.

## Objective
- To analyze the client’s social media data to provide actionable insights for improving content strategy and engagement.
- Present findings to the client and internal stakeholders through a PowerPoint presentation and video summary.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Alteryx**: Used for cleaning, modeling, and analyzing the datasets.
- **PowerPoint**: Created a detailed presentation to communicate the findings.
- **Video Presentation**: Developed a video to highlight key insights and recommendations.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: 
   - Processed 7 datasets related to social media interactions, user demographics, content categories, and engagement metrics.
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
   
2. **Data Modeling & Analysis**:
   - Used Alteryx workflows to model the data and uncover patterns and trends in user engagement, content type performance, and audience demographics.
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to highlight key factors driving content success.

3. **Insights & Recommendations**:
   - Identified content trends and strategic opportunities to increase user engagement and brand reach.
   - Highlighted recommendations based on data-driven insights to guide the client’s future content strategy.

4. **Presentation & Communication**:
   - Delivered insights via a PowerPoint deck for clear communication of results to both client and internal stakeholders.
   - Created a video summary highlighting key trends and recommendations.

## Deliverables
- **PowerPoint Deck**: A comprehensive slide deck detailing the analysis and recommendations.
- **Video Presentation**: A video summarizing key insights for the client.

## Key Insights
- Discovered optimal content categories that drive engagement.
- Identified patterns in user behavior that could inform content scheduling and targeting.
- Recommended strategic adjustments to the client’s social media strategy based on data trends.

## Conclusion
The simulation provided hands-on experience in using data analytics to drive strategic decision-making for social media clients. It highlighted the importance of data-driven insights for refining content strategies and improving user engagement.
